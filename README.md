The Cloud Data Quality Reporting Dashboard Template is designed to provide a framework to capture reporting metrics for data quality issues by extracting the Profile Details from the CDQ Profile Warehouse. Furthermore, it demonstrates how to visualize the profiling data in a business intelligence tool. 

Template includes a Python Script, and a sample Power BI Report and Dashboards illustrating DQ metrics. In addition, it includes sample data files on which provided Power BI Report is build, to allow you to view the reports without having the system up and running and generating metrics.
